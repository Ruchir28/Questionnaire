1. Users not part of space are also able to send questions to space, have a check on it.
2. first render is not sorted based on upvotes
3. on reloading the space page, it reauthenticates and in the meantime redirects to the login page, which in turn 
after authentication redirects to home page. so basically on reloading we are on home page, need to fix this
4. better segregate the token avalibilty to seprate hook because while first sign in , retry has already reached it's limit and even after user signing in and token being set 
we aren't initiating a ws connection.
